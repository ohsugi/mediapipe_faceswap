# Setup

cd mediapipe_faceswap
conda create -n mediapipe_faceswap python==3.10.9

# Usage:

## realtime_face_swaping.py:

face swap with Dlib model.

Put your desired images in the " faces " folder in the root folder. For example, I put some aligned face images generated by [this-person-does-not-exist.com](https://this-person-does-not-exist.com/en) that are not existing in this world so that you can have anonymized identifications.

```python
python realtime_face_swapping.py
```

## media_pipe_sample.py

face swap with mediapipe landmark model.

```python
python media_pipe_sample.py
```
